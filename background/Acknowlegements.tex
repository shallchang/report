First and foremost, I would like to thank my supervisor Dr Steffen van Bakel for his help, time and suggestions during the project. His patience and passion inspired me to work hard on the project. He explained every knowledge and concept that I was not familiar with and he also helped me during his holidays.  

I also would like to extend my great gratitude to my parents. Their support and love encouraged me to carry on and make progress.

I am much grateful to my friend Shiyuan Cai in the University of Oxford. Her help at the start of the project made my up to speed and her suggestions helped me solve problems in the lambda calculus and Haskell. 

Finally, I would like to thank all my friends and fellow that worked together in the lab. We shared a memorable time during 2 months.
